Slayer â€“ South Of Heaven Lyrics\n\nAn unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time.\nUnsuspecting victims no warnings, no signs.\nJudgment day the second coming arrives.\nBefore you see the light you must die.\n\nForgotten children, conform a new faith,\nAvidity and lust controlled by hate.\n[The] Never ending search for your shattered sanity,\nSouls of Damnation in their own reality.\n\nChaos rampant,\nAn age of distrust.\nConfrontations.\nImpulsive habitat.\n\nBastard sons beget your cunting daughters,\nPromiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers.\nEngreat souls condemned for all eternity,\nSustained by immoral observance a domineering deity.\n\nChaos rampant,\nAn age of distrust.\nConfrontations.\nImpulsive sabbath.\n\nOn and on, south of heaven\nOn and on, south of heaven\nOn and on, south of heaven\nOn and on, south of heaven\n\nThe root of all evil is the heart of a black soul.\nA force that has lived all eternity.\nA never ending search for a truth never told.\nThe loss of all hope and your dignity.\n\nChaos rampant,\nAn age of distrust.\nConfrontations.\nImpulsive habitat.\n\nOn and on, south of heaven \nOn and on, south of heaven\nOn and on, south of heaven\nOn and on, south of heaven
